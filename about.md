# A bit about me

## Profile

 - 10 years' experience, split 50:50 between green and brown field.
 - Web, desktop and native mobile.
 - All of my learning comes from doing, and I have done a fair few things.
 - From PM to Graphic designer, my colleagues will let you know that I'm a pleasure to work with. Many of my best friends are current and ex-workmates.
 - I enjoy employment in any organisation which values good software development practice and the inherent benefits this provides.
 - Currently doing a lot of UX-led work, often with a data angle.

## Interests

 - Outside of work, I try to keep up to date with the latest tech through reading and attending various tech meetups. I am quite sociable and will (almost) never say no to a pint at the end of the week. I do dabble in personal projects, if the challenge is interesting enough.  I keep healthy by taking part in relatively undemanding activities like swimming, cycling and obstacle courses.
