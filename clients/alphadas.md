## Feasibility study

- Location: London
- Aim: Deduce whether is is possible to move their n-Tier application (with physical hardware restrictions), to a cloud-based architecture with a re-engineered data access layer that permitted standalone deployment of the application behind an organisational firewall.
- Role: Analyst
- Duration: 3 weeks
- Notable challenges/experience:
    - The application was not well documented, so I had to caveat lots of my observations.
    - With only hypothetical scenarios, recommendations had to be broad, and estimation high.
- Tech stack:
    - SQL Server
    - MS Project
    - MS Visio
