## Marketing website

- Location: London
- Aim: Template PHP marketing site (single code base with multiple sites depending on URL routing). Data sourced from a local SQLite database, which is updated periodically using a cUrl command running off a background service which calls a Datownia API secured by OAuth 2.0.
- Role: Developer
- Duration: 4 weeks
- Notable challenges/experience:
    - A single codebase, with dynamic site content based off a spreadsheet.
    - In retrospect, a free CMS would have been a better choice.
- Tech stack:
    - SQLite
    - JQuery
    - PHP
    - OAuth 2.0
