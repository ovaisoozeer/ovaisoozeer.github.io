### Education

Some fields require practitioners to have a wealth of theoretical knowledge.

Software development requires some, but proficiency is gained through practical application and lessons learned by doing.

I'd take a growth mindset, over a technical certification, any day.

Before I reached this opinion, I was led to believe that you needed a degree to get anywhere. So, I did one:

#### Sept 2004 - Jun 2008, BSc (Hons) Software Engineering at Sheffield Hallam University.

- Graduated with Honours.
- 2nd and 3rd year optional modules: Efficient C++, and Games programming.
