# Education

Some fields require practitioners to have a wealth of theoretical knowledge.

Software development requires some, but proficiency is gained through practical application and lessons learned by doing.

I'd take a growth mindset, over technical certification, any day.

Before I reached this opinion, I was led to believe that you needed a degree to get anywhere. So, I did one.

## University

- BSc (Hons) Software Engineering at Sheffield Hallam University \[graduated June 2008\]
- Electives: Efficient C++, Games programming.

## College

- Cambridge Higher School Certificate: Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics, French.
- I spent my teenage years in Mauritius, where I was unanimously voted best student overall in sixth form.
- Also set up a registered charity on the island to aid impoverished areas, wherein I acted as secretary for a year.
