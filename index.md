## "Smiles and offers to shake your hand"

Hello, and thanks for taking the time to visit the site!

My name's Ovais, and I'm a software developer with a passion for defining and delivering long-lived solutions.

_TODO: Hats that fit._

Whilst technically proficient, I focus heavily on the human side of the business, supporting teams to discover and achieve their outcomes.

I believe that fast feedback loops and transparent dialogue with key stakeholders can overcome many of the hurdles commonly faced by software projects.

On this site, you can view a summary of the [projects and clients](client-list) I have been involved with during [my career](employment-history), and a little about my varied [skill set](skills-summary).

For more information, let's have a chat some time.
