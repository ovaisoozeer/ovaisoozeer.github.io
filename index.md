# "Smiles and offers to shake your hand"

Hello, and thanks for taking the time to visit!

My name's Ovais, and I'm a software developer with experience in defining and delivering software in an [agile manner](http://www.agilemaxims.com/).  I am happy to work for any organisation with a set of values that I can proudly stand behind.

On the site, you can view a summary of the [projects and clients](client-list) I have been involved with during [my career](employment-history), and a little about my varied [skill set](skills-summary).

I've tried to capture the essence of my profile below; of course I'm happy to have a conversation about any of these points:
- I'm **technically proficient**, but focus heavily on the **human** side of my practice, supporting teams to discover and achieve their outcomes.
- My skill in **estimation and prioritisation** is mainly gained from continuous delivery and product development, working closely with stakeholders.
- I'm comfortable with **facilitation**, combining my experience in event organisation, and collaboraion within cross-functional delivery teams.
- At the start of a project, I can help you to **establish good habits**, to ensure a build and deployment process that is resilient to change.
- During projects, I encouraging **short feedback loops, transparent conversation, and revisiting context/constraints** in order to make good and timely decisions.
- If I've done my job right, the end of any project should be **stress-free**.
