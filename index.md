# "Smiles and offers to shake your hand."

Hello, and thanks for taking the time to visit!

My name is Ovais, and I'm a software developer with experience in defining and delivering software in an [agile manner](http://www.agilemaxims.com/).  I love to work for any organisation with a set of values that I can proudly represent.

Please follow the links to view a summary of the [clients](client-list) I have worked with during [my career](employment-history), and a little about my [skill set](skills-summary).

I've distilled the essence of my profile below, but a conversation is always better. Please do [get in touch](contact) if you would like to know more:

- I'm **technically proficient**, and focus heavily on the **human** side of my practice, supporting teams to discover and achieve their outcomes.
- My skills in **estimation and prioritisation** have been honed from continuous delivery, and product development, where I have worked closely with stakeholders.
- I'm very comfortable with **facilitation**, as it combines my experience in event management, collaboration with cross-functional delivery teams, and stakeholder engagement.
- At the start of a project, I can help you by **establishing good habits**, to ensure a secure, resilient build and deployment process which embraces change (this is to be expected, not feared).
- During projects, I practice and encourage **short feedback loops, transparent and open conversations, and constant reviews of context and constraints**.  These enable good and timely decisions, which are in turn critical to success.
- I encourage teams to **celebrate success** not only at the end, but throughout any project.
