## "Smiles and offers to shake your hand"

Hello, and thanks for taking the time to visit the site!

My name's Ovais, and I'm a software developer with a passion for defining and delivering long-lived solutions.

Whilst technically proficient, I focus heavily on the human side of the practice, supporting teams to discover and achieve their outcomes.

I believe that fast feedback, and frequent dialogue with stakeholders using shared terminology around a shared vision, can overcome many of the hurdles commonly faced by software projects.

I can help you to establish good habits at the start of a project, to ensure a build and deployment process that is resilient to change.  During projects, I encouraging learning and providing accurate feedback/reality checks.  If I've done my job right, the end of any project should be stress-free.

On this site, you can view a summary of the [projects and clients](client-list) I have been involved with during [my career](employment-history), and a little about my varied [skill set](skills-summary).

I am at the stage in my career where I have learned where it's beneficial to compromise and which rules are not worth breaking. I am happy to work for any organisation with a set of values that I can proudly stand behind, and that rewards employees commensurately for their effort.

For more information, let's have a chat some time.
