## "Smiles and offers to shake your hand"

Hello, and thanks for taking the time to visit the site!

My name's Ovais, and I'm a software developer with a passion for defining and delivering long lived solutions.

Whilst technically proficient, I focus heavily on the human side of the business, supporting teams to achieve optimal outcomes.

I believe that empowered delivery teams, fast feedback loops and transparent dialogue can overcome many hurdles commonly faced by developers.

On this site, you can view a summary of the [projects and technologies](project-summaries) I have worked on throughout [my career](career-history), and a little about my resultant varied [skill set](skills-summary).

However, if it's a CV you're after, please [click here](https://1drv.ms/b/s!AiXdbfYFdG7ugiysMvRb9IsVYo_C) for a PDF.
