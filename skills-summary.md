- Search: Au fait with indexing/searching using the Elastic stack.
- Messaging: Have used message bus tech to good effect (RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus, Kafka).

### Server-side development

- I also have experience in Java development.
- Limited PHP experience.
- More recently, I have been targeting Azure's IaaS and PaaS offerings.

### Mobile

- Both native and web mobile development.  Admittedly, it's been a while.
- If you check out my portfolio, I have worked on several iOS projects and a Windows Phone one that was genuinely a pleasure to do. My iOS experience was limited due to other commitments, but I retain an interest in the platform.

### Source Control

- My experience with Git has been awesome - it's a very powerful tool for small teams and great for a geographically distributed team. SVN is a bit dated, but I have used it and can do if required to. And TFS is a necessary evil.

### Front-end development

- Familiar with encryption algorithms and their usage over the web and in programming in general.
- Have experience setting up various web authentication methods.
