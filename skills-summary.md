# Skills summary

Here are my [technical skills](#technical-skills) and other [software delivery acumen](#software-delivery-acumen).

Some fields of expertise require practitioners to have a wealth of theoretical knowledge.

Software development requires some of this, but you become proficient through practice.

Specific, project-related technologies are listed against individual [clients](client-list).

### Testing

- Fan of developing software using a test-driven approach to behaviour, infrastructure, security and analytics.
- Experienced with test automation frameworks and resulting artifacts used to support project decisions.

_E.g.: All projects (to varying degrees)._

### Build, Deployment, and Source Control

- Fan of test-driven and behaviour-driven development. This implies a gated continuous integration pipeline.
- Prefer Git over SVN/TFS.  Flexible with branching strategy, though I prefer trunk-based development.

_E.g.: [Toyota](clients/tfs), [Creator](clients/creator)_

### Integrations

It seems silly to note the various APIs I have had to use, but some may it useful to know that I have some experience with these: Twitter · LinkedIn · facebook · Dropbox · Box.com · Google Accounts · Google Drive · Google Analytics · LIVE accounts · Yahoo accounts · iTunes loader · SongKick · SeatWave · DocuSign · Signicat.

## Software Delivery Acumen

### Analysis

As a consultant, I am experienced in deducing needs from wants.

Fan of domain driven design, and the benefits wrought from bringing together developers and stakeholders.

### Estimation & prioritisation

A constant in development is negotiation over the next highest priority task.  I am proficient in qualifying these, in terms that can be understood by both the delivery team and other major stakeholders.

### Facilitation

I have facilitated many workshops and events both, within my teams and at an organisational level.  The process of shining a light on latent knowledge is something that I enjoy.

### Mentoring

I have had some training in mentoring, and been privileged to provide mentorship to a few people early in their careers - full credit to these amazing people, who have gone on to do bigger and better things within a short period of time.

### Recruitment

I have lots of hands-on experience in formulating a recruitment process, and conducting face-to-face and remote interviews.
