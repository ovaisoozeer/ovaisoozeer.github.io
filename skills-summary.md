# Skills summary

Some fields require practitioners to have a wealth of theoretical knowledge.

Software development requires some of this, but you become proficient through practice.

Here are the [technical](#technical) and [less-technical](#less-technical) aspects of my experience.

Specific, project-related technologies are listed against individual [clients](client-list).

### Source Control

### Security

## Less-Technical

### Analysis

As a consultant, I have had the pleasure of eliciting new requirements from clients, and performing post-mortem analyses.

### Estimation & prioritisation

A constant in development is negotiation over the next highest priority task.  I am proficient in qualifying these, in terms that can be understood by both the delivery team and other major stakeholders.

### Facilitation

I have facilitated many workshops and events both, within my teams and at an organisational level.  The process of shining a light on latent knowledge is something that I enjoy.

### Mentoring

I have had some training in mentoring, and been privileged to provide mentorship to a few people early in their careers - full credit to these amazing people, who have gone on to do bigger and better things within a short period of time.

### Recruitment

I have lots of hands-on experience in formulating a recruitment process, and conducting face-to-face and remote interviews.
